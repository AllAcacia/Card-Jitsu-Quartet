# Card-Jitsu-Quartet

## About
Master the three elements within Card-Jitsu!

## How to Compile
Run "make" in directory to compile, and "make clean" to remove all compiled files.

## How to Play
Drag and drop "Card-Jitsu-Quartet.3dsx" into the root/3ds directory of your (modded with Luma3DS) 3DS console's SD card. Open the Homebrew Launcher on your 3DS, then find the title and press "A"!

## In-Game Notes
There is very little if no gameplay implemented, as the bare basics are being implemented (this is my first time working with devkitPro). You will start at the main menu. There are options to open Card-Jitsu and its elemental variants, but only the base title has content being developed for at this moment.
